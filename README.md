# My lovely dotfiles 
These dotfiles are meant to be used with zsh.

Please fork this repository and configure it for yourself:

```
git clone https://github.com/MurtadhaM/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
~/.dotfiles/bin/dotfiles install
```

The `dotfiles install` command is going to:

* backup changed dotfiles
* symlink new ones
* show info what were installed
* remove broken symlinks

You can also use `bin/setup-darwin` for initial environment setup on OSX.
